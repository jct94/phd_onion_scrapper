[edit]  Hidden Services - Other Protocols 
Volunteers last verified that all services in this section were up, or marked as DOWN, on: 2011-06-08
 For configuration and service/uptime testing, all services in this 
section MUST list the active port in their address. Exception: HTTP on 
80, HTTPS on 443.
 For help with configuration, see the TorifyHOWTO and End-to-end connectivity issues.

[edit]  P2P FileSharing 
Running P2P protocols within Tor requires OnionCat. Therefore, see the OnionCat section for those P2P services.
IMPORTANT: It is possible to use Tor for P2P. However, if you do, the right thing must also be done by giving back the bandwidth used. Otherwise, if this is not done, Tor will be crushed taking everyone along with it.

[edit]  Dead Hidden Services 
Do not simply remove services that appear to be offline from the above list! Services can go down temporarily, so we keep track of when they do and maintain a list of dead hidden services.

 In addition to an onion simply being gone (Tor cannot resolve 
the onion), sites that display 404 (and use a known onion/URL based 
hosting service) are the only other thing that is considered truly DOWN.
 Presumably the account is gone.

 If a service has been down for a while, tag it with ' - DOWN YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went down).
 If a tagged service on the above list of live hidden services has come back up, remove the DOWN tag.
 If a tagged service is still down after a month, please move it (along with the DOWN tag) to the list of dead hidden services.

 The general idea of the remaining four service states below is 
that, if the Hidden Service Descriptor is available, and something is 
responding behind it... the service is considered up, and we track that 
fact on the Main Page. If any of these subsequently go offline, append 
the DOWN tag and handle as above.

 Hello world's / statements, minimal sites, services with low user activity, etc (while boring)... are listed as usual.
 Broken services are those that display 404 (and do not use a 
known hosting service), PHP or other errors (or they fail silently)... 
any of which prevent the use of the service as intended. They also 
include blank pages, empty dirs and neglected status notes. Presumably 
the operator is in limbo. Broken services are tagged with ' (reason) - 
Broken YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went broken)
 Services that automatically redirect to another service (such 
as by HTTP protocol or script), have their redirection destinations 
noted in their descriptions. These are tagged with ' - Redir YYYY-MM-DD'
 (your guess as to when it went redir)
 Sites that are formally closed via announcement are tagged with ' - Closed YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went closed)
